## Startups
### 1. Gather
* The requirements, goals and objectives
* Understand the AI/ML use case(s)
* Understand the current infrastructure requirements
* Understand the deployment expectations (Budget, timescales, resources)
   
### 2. Assess
* The current AI/ML model
* The maturity of the code
* The current available infrastructure
* The current data pipeline (if any)
* The Data dependencies
* The size of the current dataset
* If current data is real or synthetic
* The data source for model in production
* Skills availability within the organisation

### 3. Plan / Design
* Design the potential deployment pipeline
* Plan the deployment strategy
* Plan the metrics to be monitored

### 4. Implement
* Deploy the model
* Review the deployment strategy

### 5. Evaluate / Review
* Monitor the metrics of the model
* Observability - Model health, Data health and Service health

* The data source for model in production
* Skills availability within the organisation

### 3. Plan / Design

* Plan the deployment strategy
* Plan the metrics to be monitored

### 4. Execute
* Deploy the model
