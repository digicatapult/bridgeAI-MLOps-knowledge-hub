### Roles

The roles required to create and deploy an MLOps pipeline can vary, though our team consists of:

- Data scientists
- Data analysts
- DevOps engineers
- Machine Learning Engineers
- Domain experts/business translators

### Skills

Required skills include knowledge of:

- Scripting languages (e.g. Python)
- Cloud solutions (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP)
- CI/CD pipeline implementation and Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Terraform)
- Data stores (e.g. AWS S3)
- Machine learning algorithms (e.g. Logistic Regression) and frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, SK-Learn)
- DAG software (e.g. Airflow)
- Logging and monitoring tools (e.g. Evidently AI)
- Containerization (with Kubernetes, Docker)


## Architecture Overview

The components of an MLOps workflow, otherwise known as its architecture, can vary depending on the scope and restraints of a given project. 

Generally, the following components make up the average MLOps workflow:

1. Data store and retrieval
    * These can include databases for structured or unstructured data, data lakes, APIs and files (eg `.csv`, `.parquet`)

2. Data and feature engineering
    * This step involves the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to group and automate tasks organised with dependencies and relationships dictating how they should run. These can come with timing intervals, timeouts, etc.

3. Model training and registry 
    * This step involves the use of relevant tools for model versioning, storage, testing, and eventually model deployment subject to approval. 
    * When different iterations of models are tested, the model, its data and its hyperparameters are stored for future reference. Model registries can also store information like metadata and the lineage of a given model.

4. Model deployment 
    * When the appropriate model is selected, it is then manually pushed to the model server to serve in production. Serving a model is the act of making it accessible to end users, typically via API.

5. Model monitoring
    * Upon a model being deployed, relevant tools are then used to monitor its performance and detect occurrences of model drift, and logging

## Design Decisions: 
For the pre-built MLOps pipeline created by the team, a [deploy-as-model](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/mlops/deployment-patterns.html){:target="_blank"} approach was taken. As such, the architecture followed by the team comprises a model registry with human intervention for stage tags, model deployment, model monitoring, data storing and retrieval, and finally data and feature engineering.

It is important to note that the components and workflow differ; the components themselves comprise the architecture, but the workflow (the order in which the components are used to create an MLOps pipeline) can vary. For further insight on the typical structure of an MLOps workflow, you can refer to the following resources:
* [MLOps Stack Canvas](https://ml-ops.org/content/mlops-stack-canvas){:target="_blank"}
* [MLOps Architecture Guide](https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-architecture-guide){:target="_blank"}
* [MLOps Workflow by Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-workflow.html){:target="_blank"}


## Horizon Scan

Below are sets of comparisons for tools you can use for each component of your MLOps pipeline. The criteria for evaluation was derived using the team's [requirements](./mlops_big_picture/requirements_research.html){:target="_blank"}, which you may also wish to consider using for your own pipeline. Each horizon scan per component comes with the team's design decision for the component.

<!-- short paragraph on why a certain selection of tools for evaluation. -->

  <b>Design decisions:</b>
  <br>

  The team chose Amazon S3 as the data storage system. Digital Catapult is already using AWS for a few other projects and our technologists are comfortable with this technology.
