[<Back](README.md)

What were the requirements for our ML model and the MLOps pipeline?

- We wanted to demonstrate an end-to-end open source premade MLOps pipeline; keeping it simple to just deploy-model only; share it with startups as a starting point?
1. Should be made of open source tools, to keep it cost friendly and help with experimentation
2. The level of MLOps maturity we aimed for in the ML maturity assessment and why
3. To build a Minimum Viable MLOps pipeline with basic automation

- Where did the journey start? How did we go about building this MLOps pipeline?
1. Spike on DAG tools
2. Spike on model registry tools
3. Spike on Data Versioning tools
4. Containerisation - understanding Docker and Kubernetes
5. Spike on model monitoring
6. How we decided on using S3 for storage

- How were the design decisions made across the pipeline for each component?
