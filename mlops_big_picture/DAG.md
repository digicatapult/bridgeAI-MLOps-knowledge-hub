## 1. Introduction

This page examines the team's evaluation of two tools for training pipeline implementation, being Airflow and Prefect. Links to repositories for each sub-component of the team's training pipeline are provided; these repositories come with instructions for implementing them.

The team chose Airflow as its [DAG](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html){:target="_blank"} implementation software because it is:

- Widely used in the community based on the GitHub stars of a repository (denoting the quality of a project)
- Being contributed to by more users (reflected in Forks of repositories)
- Straightforward to set up: [Helm Chart for Apache Airflow ‚Äî helm-chart Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/index.html){:target="_blank"}

On the other hand, to run Prefect the official [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/){:target="_blank"} requires additional configurations to be setup: [Welcome to Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/3.0/get-started/index){:target="_blank"}

**Note:** Kubeflow does not have an official Helm chart.

## 2. Evaluation

### Apache Airflow

<blockquote class="callout callout_definition">
<span class="callout-icon">üìì</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Airflow is an open source workflow orchestration tool used for orchestrating distributed applications. It works by scheduling jobs across different servers or nodes using DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). A DAG is the core concept of Airflow, collecting Tasks together, organised with dependencies and relationships to say how they should run.
</blockquote>

\
**Features**
- Free
- Ease for Helm chart setup
- supports the creation of dynamic workflows through Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), enabling users to define complex dependencies and task relationships. Also viable for retraining/A-B testing or CI/CD


### Prefect

<blockquote class="callout callout_definition">
<span class="callout-icon">üìì</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Prefect decreases negative engineering by building a DAG structure with an emphasis on enabling positive with an orchestration layer for the current data stack.
</blockquote>

<br>

**Features**
- Paid
- To run Prefect, the official Helm chart requires additional configurations to be setup.
- Python package that makes it easier to design, test, operate, and construct complicated data applications. It has a user-friendly API that doesn‚Äôt require any configuration files or boilerplate. It allows for process orchestration and monitoring using best industry practices.
