## What is MLOps?

MLOps is a set of practices that aims to unify the release cycle for machine learning and software application release. This is done through application of agile principles to machine learning projects, mainly by automating the testing of machine learning artifacts (e.g. data validation, ML model testing, and ML model integration testing).


## MLOps Big Picture Summary

Each page under "MLOps: The Big Picture" has been designed to address the research, implementation and troubleshooting regarding each component of the team's MLOps pipeline. The components, which are reflective of the typical order in which data flows through an MLOps pipeline, comprise:

1. The team's initial requirements and design decisions
2. Data Versioning
3. Training Pipeline
4. Model Serving
5. Prediction Service
6. Model Monitoring
7. GitOps

## Business and Technical Approach

Aside from the research and implementation surrounding each component of our pipeline, we also captured aspects of our business and technical approaches to this project for your consideration. 

<span style="color:#8C1437"><b>Corporate perspective</b></span> considerations include a maturity assessment for evaluating the viability of your MLOps pipeline, required skills and roles and a horizon scan of tools you can use for each component of the pipeline, and a Deployment Service Life Cycle framework to use as a guide for additional considerations.
