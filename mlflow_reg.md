# MLflow Registry Evaluation
<!-- do the defaults have to be in the horizon scan?? -->
<!-- The team opted for Amazon S3 buckets, Airflow and MLflow for data storage, data engineering, and model registry and versioning, respectively.


## Amazon S3

**See: [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)**

## Airflow
**Q: Why Airflow? Airflow over Prefect or Kubeflow?**
Airflow is being widely used in the community based on the GitHub stars of a repository (denoting the quality of a project). Also based on the fork of a repository (being contributed by more users).

Also Airflow Helm chart setup is easy. [Helm Chart for Apache Airflow â€” helm-chart Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/index.html) 

To run Prefect, the official Helm chart requires additional configurations to be setup. [Welcome to Prefect - Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/3.0/get-started/index) 

## MLflow
